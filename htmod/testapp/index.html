Objective

Users must still be able to do every html operations but do more with out introductions

A template processor is a software that combines a data model with a template to give a result document
-->

<!--
it is advisable that {variables} and {context} files should be declared at
the top as by default they will be assumed declared at the top, so for
your understanding, top is best.
-->

<!--
you shouldbe able to include file
relatively to template file
-->

<!--
There are different variable scopes for a specific template
- global scope
- block scope

Note that blocks should still have access to parent scopes for variable
not overshadowed in the block
-->

<!--
Variables declared should be placed in their immediate scope, the system
move up the heiracy to search for needed variables
-->

<!--
Expected features

***************
## Variables ##
***************

We should be able to create variables
<t$ name := 'Abdulfatai'>

We should be able to render variables to page
<t= $name is $age year hold>

We should be able to pass variables to functions when rendering
<t= name|upcase|maxchr:5>

We should be able to update a variable
<t$ name := 'Aka'>

****************
## Evaluation ##
****************

- composite expressions for evaluation should be enclosed in ()
- the behave like variables that nust returns a value




- Using function : uses defined functions
- Includes : include other external files
- Looping
- Conditional
- Assignments : Passing references to sub templates
- Errors : outputs template script errors
- Natural Template : Does not break the actual structure of the template
- Inheritance : Allow to extend for a layout

<t$ age := 20>

<html>
<head>
  <t+ '/partials/head'>
</head>
<body>

  <!-- evaluate an expression -->
  <t$ age := (age + years)>

  <ul>
    <t* name :in names>
      <li><t= (name + ' ' + sex)> is <t= age> years hold</t></li>
    </t*>
  </ul>

  <h1>What is your age range</h1>
  
  <t% age :gt 10 :& age :lt 20>
    <h6>I am in Adult group</h6>
  <t!% (age :lt 20 :: age :eq 40)>
    <h6>I am in Young group</h6>
